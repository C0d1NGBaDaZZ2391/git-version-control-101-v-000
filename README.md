# Version Control 101

## Introduction: What Is Version Control?

> “The past is never where you think you left it.” — [Katherine Anne Porter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Anne_Porter)

Version Control is the process of storing multiple versions of a single project, allowing each version to be recalled at a later date.

There are a lot of different ways to do version control— you could save a new file every time you make a change, date that file, and place all of those files into a unique folder. You could track all of your changes in a spreadsheet with copious notes... Or you could use dedicated version control software. Guess which one programers do?

## Why Use Version Control?

Let's think about the future for a second. It's a year or two down the road and you're working at your dream job. You just deployed a new chat feature for the website you're working on. Suddenly, your boss runs over to your desk. "Wait! We can't deploy the chat feature yet! Revert! Revert!"

What do you do? Well, since you used version control software, it's as easy as 123. Actually, it's as easy as `git reset --hard <commit id>`... but we'll get to that later. Using version control is useful because it allows you to easily rollback to a previous version of your application.

There are a lot of advantages to version control. It's great way to keep a backup of your work, it facilitates collaboration, and gives you the freedom to experiment and try new things without messing up the code base.
